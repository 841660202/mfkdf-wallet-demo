This repository illustrates how to use MFKDF to build a strong trustless decentralized cryptocurrency wallet application featuring multi-factor key derivation with self-service key recovery. It uses IPFS and IPNS to store MFKDF policy files. The application exists for demonstration purposes only. It has not been tested/audited as thoroughly as the core MFKDF library, and is not intended to be used as a production-ready application.

Based on the 2017 [eth-hot-wallet](https://github.com/PaulLaux/eth-hot-wallet) project by [Paul Laux](https://github.com/PaulLaux).
